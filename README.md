# IC_IFSP_2018
//Projeto de Iniciação cientifica IFSP
This is the documentation about my Scientific Initiation Scholarship at IFSP. My project is about MPPT, and monitoring solar panels.
The start point of this project is to use an Arduino UNO, who will work as a controller for another circuit acting as electronic load.
