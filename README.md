# IC_IFSP_2018
//Projeto de Iniciação cientifica IFSP
This is the documentation about my Scientific Initiation Scholarship at IFSP. My project is about MPPT, and monitoring solar panels.
The start point of this project is to use an Arduino UNO, who will work as a controller for another circuit acting as electronic load.

I tried to implement I2C sensor to my project, so I made an example using ADS1115 and OLED, at Arduino NANO.

I tried to implement an interrupt using TIMER2 from Atmega, it worked fine, this interrupt will charge and discharge a capacitor at the gate of an MOSFET.
After I tried to implemtent a Datalogger using a SD Card while the interrupt at the background.
It worked well.
